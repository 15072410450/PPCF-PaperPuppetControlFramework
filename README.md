# PPCF-PaperPuppetControlFramework
Universal control framework about paper puppets. In addition, you can set the speed of a move. The frame can drive up to eight servos for movement. Servos can be used to drive joints, as well as eye and ear movements. In the future, a 16-servo version will be developed to achieve richer actions

### Code on mcu
Working on it  :)

### Structure
Up to 8 servos moving asynchronously (because it uses interrupts)ï¼Œwe can only turn up to 8 joints. The test version fixes the position of the servo to test the feasibility
